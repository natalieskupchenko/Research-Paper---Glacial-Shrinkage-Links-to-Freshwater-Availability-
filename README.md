# Glacial Shrinkage & Freshwater Availability in Western Canada

This repository contains an academic research paper examining how climate-change–driven glacier retreat in Western Canada threatens long-term freshwater availability.

The paper was written as an term project for SCIE 113 at UBC and is based on an extensive review of peer-reviewed literature in glaciology, hydrology, and environmental science.

## Research Focus

**Primary question:**  
How will climate-change–driven glacial shrinkage affect freshwater availability in Western Canada over the 21st century?

---

## Key Topics Covered

- Glacier mass balance and the concept of *peak water*
- Long-term changes in discharge from glacier-fed watersheds
- Seasonal freshwater shortages linked to glacier retreat
- Impacts of altered flow regimes on water quality
- Increased concentrations of organochlorine contaminants in meltwater
- Limitations of groundwater buffering as a long-term solution

---

## Key Conclusions

- After glaciers pass peak water, freshwater discharge declines significantly
- Reduced glacier mass exacerbates summer freshwater shortages
- Glacier retreat can increase contaminant concentrations in freshwater systems
- Groundwater storage may temporarily buffer water loss, but is not a sustainable long-term replacement
- Climate mitigation and proactive water management are critical to protecting future freshwater availability

## Skills Demonstrated

- Scientific literature review and synthesis
- Evidence-based argumentation
- Systems-level environmental reasoning
- Evaluation of counterarguments and limitations
- Clear written communication of complex scientific concepts

## Context

This project complements spatial and quantitative environmental analysis work (e.g. GIS-based terrain suitability analysis) by focusing on **conceptual reasoning, scientific synthesis, and policy-relevant environmental impacts**.
